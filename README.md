# Discounted-price-prediction-model
o In this project, I've developed a prediction model using Random Forest Regression Algorithm.
o Here, the model predicts the discounted price of the products after being trained using descriptions of products from Flipkart and Amazon in the dataset. 
Using EDA, feature engineering, hyper-tuning, and other features improved the RMSE value for the model.
